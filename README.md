# Full Stack FastAPI with GraphQL - Base Project Generator

Generate a backend and frontend (wip) stack using Python, including interactive GraphQL API documentation.

### Interactive API documentation

This example shows the [postman](http://postman.com) environment, api, and an example of getting an auth token and creating an item. Note, not using GraphiQL since it doesn't support authentication headers.

## Features

* Full **Docker** integration (Docker based).
* Docker Swarm Mode deployment. (wip)
* **Docker Compose** integration and optimization for local development.
* **Production ready** Python web server using Uvicorn and Gunicorn. (wip)
* Python <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">**FastAPI**</a> backend:
    * **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
    * **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
    * **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
    * **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
    * **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
    * **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> and <a href="http://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.
    * <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/" class="external-link" target="_blank">**Many other features**</a> including automatic validation, serialization, interactive documentation, authentication with OAuth2 JWT tokens, etc.
* **Secure password** hashing by default.
* **JWT token** authentication.
* **SQLAlchemy** models (independent of Flask extensions, so they can be used with Celery workers directly).
* Basic starting models for users (modify and remove as you need).
* **Alembic** migrations.
* **CORS** (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
* **Celery** worker that can import and use models and code from the rest of the backend selectively.
* REST backend tests based on **Pytest**, integrated with Docker, so you can test the full API interaction, independent on the database. As it runs in Docker, it can build a new data store from scratch each time (so you can use ElasticSearch, MongoDB, CouchDB, or whatever you want, and just test that the API works).

* **React** frontend:

## How to use it

Go to the directory where you want to create your project and run:

```bash
git clone this project
docker-compose up
```


## How to deploy (wip)

This stack can be adjusted and used with several deployment options that are compatible with Docker Compose, but it is designed to be used in a cluster controlled with pure Docker in Swarm Mode with a Traefik main load balancer proxy handling automatic HTTPS certificates, using the ideas from <a href="https://dockerswarm.rocks" target="_blank">DockerSwarm.rocks</a>.

Please refer to <a href="https://dockerswarm.rocks" target="_blank">DockerSwarm.rocks</a> to see how to deploy such a cluster in 20 minutes.
